## ✨ About the Game

This game is based in part on Indian Hindu Mythology and centers around two legendary characters: **Tara** and **Bhima**. The gameplay and card abilities are inspired by their mythological stories, bringing a unique cultural flavor to the card battle genre.

The game is also inspired by Blizzard Entertainment's **Hearthstone**, adapting its engaging mechanics and strategic depth to a new mythological setting.
